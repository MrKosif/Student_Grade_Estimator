# Student_Grade_Estimator
I build this project in the first year at my university. It is about guessing a student's future grades using collaborative filtering.

For proper test use the documents that I uploaded.

Due to mistakes that I made in the past, "Upload Letter Grade Data" button is not working. So do not touch it. However you still need to upload the other files from the main file. So use other two button to upload them.

I used the file that contains a lot of functions for collaborative filtering while makinng this project. Because I build this project before algorithm classes. : )


Instructions:

1) Upload the files.
2)Choose the minimum grade that you wished to have.
3)Select the subjects you wised to take.
4)Select the courses you wanted.
